Your task is to act as a precise data extraction engine for a German BSI IT-Grundschutz "Baustein" PDF.

Your instructions are:
1.  Identify the Baustein's unique ID from the document title (e.g., "CON.1.1").
2.  From Chapter 1.1, "Einleitung", extract the complete prose.
3.  From Chapter 1.2, "Zielsetzung", extract the complete prose.
4.  From Chapter 1.3, "Abgrenzung und Modellierung", extract the complete prose.
5.  From Chapter 2, "Gefährdungslage", extract the list of all described threats/risks ("Gefährdungen").

You MUST return ONLY a single, raw JSON object. The JSON object must strictly follow this structure:

{
  "id": "The Baustein ID you identified",
  "parts": [
    {
      "name": "introduction",
      "title": "Einleitung",
      "prose": "The full prose from Chapter 1.1"
    },
    {
      "name": "objective",
      "title": "Zielsetzung",
      "prose": "The full prose from Chapter 1.2"
    },
    {
      "name": "usage",
      "title": "Abgrenzung und Modellierung",
      "prose": "The full prose from Chapter 1.3"
    },
    {
      "name": "risk",
      "title": "The full title of the first risk (e.g., G 0.1 Mangelhafte Organisation)",
      "prose": "The full description for the first risk"
    },
    {
      "name": "risk",
      "title": "The full title of the second risk",
      "prose": "The full description for the second risk"
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT RULES:
- The `parts` array must contain exactly ONE object for each of the introduction, objective, and usage chapters.
- The `parts` array must contain one object for EACH risk found in Chapter 2.
- For each risk `part`, the `name` MUST be the string "risk". The `title` field contains the full risk title, and `prose` contains its description.
- Your final output must be ONLY the JSON object.
