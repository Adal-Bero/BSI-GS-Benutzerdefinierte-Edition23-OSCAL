## 1. The AI-Powered Quality Control & Enrichment Process

This pipeline's primary function is to perform a sophisticated, multi-faceted quality control and enrichment cycle on an OSCAL-based security catalog. It goes beyond simple linting or syntax checks by using a large language model (Google Gemini 2.5 Pro) to analyze the semantic meaning, context, and completeness of security controls.

The entire process is governed by a strict, "human-on-the-loop" philosophy, where the AI provides expert analysis and suggestions in a structured format, but the Python script handles the final, deterministic assembly and validation.

The process can be broken down into three key phases:

### 1.1. Focused, Contextual Input (The "Stub")

To ensure the highest quality response and avoid model drift, the script does **not** send the entire catalog to the AI. Instead, for each control being processed, it generates a minimal, focused JSON object called a "stub." This stub contains only the essential information needed for a contextual analysis:

*   **Baustein Context:** The ID and Title of the parent "Baustein" (e.g., `ISMS.1`, `Sicherheitsmanagement`). This tells the model the overall security domain.
*   **Control Context:** The ID and Title of the specific control being evaluated (e.g., `ISMS.1.A1`, `Übernahme der Gesamtverantwortung...`).
*   **Prose to Evaluate:** A list of all the maturity-level prose texts (`statement`, `guidance`, `assessment-method`) associated with that control. Each piece of prose is paired with its unique ID.

This "pre-filtering" of data is a critical architectural choice that forces the model to concentrate only on the relevant data, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs.

### 1.2. Multi-Faceted AI Analysis

Once the model receives the stub, it executes a series of tasks defined in the `quality_check_prompt.txt`:

1.  **Prose Quality Analysis & Improvement Commentary:**
    *   For each piece of prose text, the model uses its training and **grounding in Google Search** to evaluate its quality. It assesses if the text is technically sound, clear, and relevant to the given Baustein and control context.
    *   It then performs its first enrichment task: writing a concise **commentary** on the quality of the `prose`. This feedback, placed in the `prose_qs` field, provides expert suggestions on how to improve the clarity, technical accuracy, or contextual relevance of the control text.

2.  **Holistic Gap Analysis:**
    *   This is the most advanced analysis step. The model looks beyond the provided text and considers the **entire security topic** of the Baustein.
    *   For example, if the Baustein is "Personnel Security" and the provided controls only cover employee onboarding, the AI uses its grounded knowledge to identify that a critical control for "employee offboarding" is missing.

3.  **New Control Suggestion:**
    *   If the gap analysis identifies a missing topic, the model generates one or more new, fully-formed OSCAL `control` objects to fill that gap.
    *   These suggestions include a new ID, a clear title, and a `statement` part with prose describing the new requirement.

### 1.3. The "Schema as Quality Gates" Principle

The pipeline's reliability hinges on a series of validation steps using JSON schemas:

1.  **Input Validation (Implicit):** The `gemini_input_stub_schema.json` defines the structure of the data sent to the model, ensuring consistency.
2.  **Output Validation (Explicit):** The AI's JSON response is immediately validated against the `gemini_output_stub_schema.json`. If the response does not match the expected structure (e.g., missing a required field), the response is rejected, logged, and the pipeline's retry logic is triggered. This is a critical quality gate that prevents malformed or incomplete AI suggestions from corrupting the data.
3.  **Final Catalog Validation:** After all processing is complete and the AI's suggestions have been merged, the entire, final catalog object is validated against the master `bsi_gk_2023_oscal_schema.json`. The script will **fail and refuse to upload** the result if the final product does not conform to the master schema.

This layered validation ensures that the pipeline produces structured, predictable, and valid outputs, even when leveraging a non-deterministic AI model.

## 2. Pipeline Architecture & Stages

The `main.py` script executes the process in several distinct stages:

1.  **Initialization & Configuration:**
    *   Loads all required configuration from environment variables.
    *   Sets up logging based on `TEST` mode.
    *   Initializes clients for Google Cloud Storage and the Google GenAI SDK.

2.  **Data Loading & Sanitization:**
    *   Downloads the master OSCAL catalog.
    *   Performs the "sanitization" step (`ensure_prose_part_ids`) to programmatically add unique IDs to any text parts that are missing them, enabling reliable data mapping.

3.  **Component Processing Loop:**
    *   The script processes one component file at a time, extracting the list of `control-id`s to be checked.

4.  **AI-Powered Enrichment (Concurrent):**
    *   For each `control-id`, a concurrent task is created (managed by an `asyncio.Semaphore`).
    *   The task runs the full analysis cycle described in Chapter 1.

5.  **Data Merging & Synchronization:**
    *   The validated results from Gemini are merged back into the in-memory master catalog using a thread-safe lock.
    *   New controls are added to both the master catalog and the relevant component file.

6.  **Final Validation & Upload:**
    *   The entire modified catalog is validated against the master OSCAL schema.
    *   If valid, the final catalog and any modified component files are uploaded to the output GCS path.

## 4. How to Use

### 4.1. Local Setup & Configuration

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.10+
    *   `gcloud` CLI authenticated to your GCP project (`gcloud auth application-default login`)

2.  **Installation:**
    ```bash
    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    The script is configured entirely via environment variables. Create a `.env` file for local testing (note: this file should **not** be committed to version control).

    **.env example:**
    ```bash
    export GCP_PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"
    export BUCKET_NAME="your-gcs-bucket-name"
    export SOURCE_PREFIX="path/to/your/components/"
    export OUTPUT_PREFIX="path/for/your/results/"
    export EXISTING_JSON_GCS_PATH="path/to/your/master-catalog.json"
    export TEST="true" # Set to "false" for a full run
    ```

### 4.2. Deployment with Google Cloud Run Jobs

This script is designed to run as a serverless batch job.

#### Step 1: Containerize the Application

Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.12-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container at /app
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application's code into the container
COPY . .

# Define the command to run your app
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

#### Step 2: Build and Push the Container to Artifact Registry

First, ensure you have an Artifact Registry repository. If not, create one:
```bash
gcloud artifacts repositories create [REPO_NAME] --repository-format=docker --location=[REGION] --description="Container images for batch jobs"
```

Now, build the container image and push it:
```bash
export GCP_PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"
export REGION="your-region" # e.g., us-central1
export REPO_NAME="your-repo-name"
export IMAGE_NAME="oscal-quality-pipeline"

gcloud builds submit --tag ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${GCP_PROJECT_ID}/${REPO_NAME}/${IMAGE_NAME}:latest
```

#### Step 3: Create and Execute the Cloud Run Job

Create a dedicated service account for the job to run with the principle of least privilege.```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create oscal-job-runner --display-name="Service Account for OSCAL Pipeline Job"
```

Grant it the necessary permissions:
```bash
# Permission to read/write GCS objects
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${GCP_PROJECT_ID} \
  --member="serviceAccount:oscal-job-runner@${GCP_PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/storage.objectAdmin"

# Permission to use the GenAI/Vertex AI services
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${GCP_PROJECT_ID} \
  --member="serviceAccount:oscal-job-runner@${GCP_PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/aiplatform.user"
```

Now, create the job, setting all the required environment variables.
```bash
export BUCKET="your-gcs-bucket-name"
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT="oscal-job-runner@${GCP_PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

gcloud run jobs create oscal-quality-job --image ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${GCP_PROJECT_ID}/${REPO_NAME}/${IMAGE_NAME}:latest --region ${REGION} \
  --set-env-vars=GCP_PROJECT_ID=${GCP_PROJECT_ID} \
  --set-env-vars=BUCKET_NAME=${BUCKET} \
  --set-env-vars=SOURCE_PREFIX="path/to/your/components/" \
  --set-env-vars=OUTPUT_PREFIX="path/for/your/results/" \
  --set-env-vars=EXISTING_JSON_GCS_PATH="path/to/your/master-catalog.json" \
  --set-env-vars=TEST="false" \
  --service-account=${SERVICE_ACCOUNT} \
  --tasks=1 \
  --max-retries=3
```

Finally, execute the job:
```bash
gcloud run jobs execute oscal-quality-job --region ${REGION}
```
