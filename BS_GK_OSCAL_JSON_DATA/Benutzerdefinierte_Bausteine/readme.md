I needed test data to try the new function to add bausteine to an existing JSON. So I created a few. Accidentially for topics that could be a good addition to the next edition, but the controls are not verified, proof read and peer reviewed. Just gemini-2.5-pro best practice recommendations. Based on a list of missing bausteinen from O3 and gemini together.

THIS is NOT production quality!

But could be a starting point for the manual review process with comments from experts.
